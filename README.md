Sanitize
========

Seaside-based text and html tags sanitizer. From wikipedia: "HTML sanitization is the process of examining an HTML document and producing a new HTML document that preserves only whatever tags are designated "safe". HTML sanitization can be used to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing any HTML code submitted by a user."
